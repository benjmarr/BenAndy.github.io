== CHANGELOG ==

We've been moving some servers around.

So far, our experiences (no, we weren't paid to write any of this):
- Linode: Great. They're pretty damn good, there's nothing else to say. Their support is excellent. We'd recommend them to anyone.
- Black Lotus: Their support is the best and their servers are great. Kind of expensive but well worth the price.
- AWS: Too expensive. Seriously, look elsewhere (hint: this list).
- CloudFlare: Not really a server hoster but worth a mention: Their support isn't that good, but their service is, especially for their rates.

--

Added the "Teams" game mode. It's still being tweaked to prevent a team from snowballing too hard.

--

Added Spectator mode and improved performance.

--

Made big cells slighty faster. Fixed split range. Ejected mass now loses 10% of its mass (you lose X mass, but the ejected mass only has 0.9x mass).

--

Moved South America servers back to Atlanta.

--

I've moved the South America server to AWS in Brazil. However this might not be permanent as AWS is incredibly expensive.

--

I've added a South America server, but please notice that it's *not* hosted in South America at the moment. It's hosted in Atlanta. We haven't found a good server provider yet.

--

Added a China region, it's hosted in Tokyo though. It doesn't have many servers at the moment because linode does not have any servers available, hopefully we manage to grab more in the next few hours.

--

Added Russia and Oceania regions. Notice that Russian servers are actually hosted in London, and Oceania servers are hosted in Singapore.

--

Massively increased the size of the map.

--

Reverted game back to the state it was a few days ago. I feel like there's a better way to add features without unbalacing the game, so I'll try that out soon.

There might be a Oceania server coming if there is interest. A South American server is planned but we're still trying to find a suitable host there.

A party system is in the works.
