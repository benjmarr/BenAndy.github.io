Between Benjamin Developments
and [add[CUSTOMER NAME]].

Summary:
We'll always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it's important to have things written down so that we both know what's what, who should do what, when and why, and what will happen if something goes terribly wrong. In this contract you won't find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. Benjamin Developments have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;
You [add[CUSTOMER NAME]], located at [add[CUSTOMER ADDRESS]] ("You") are hiring us Benjamin Developments ("We" or "Us") to:
- Develop a website;
for the estimated price of [add[TOTAL JOB PRICE]] as outlined in our previous correspondence. We'll get into more detail soon...

What do both parties agree to?
YOU: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You'll give us the assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project. You'll do this when we ask and provide it in the formats we ask for. You'll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set together. We also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

US: We have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed with you and we'll do it all in a professional and timely matter. We'll endeavour to meet every deadline that's set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

GETTING INTO THE IMPORTANT SECTION...

Design:
Benjamin Developments does not design websites, we only develop them. Before coming to us you must go to a web designer and get web designs from them to pass onto us before we can get the development underway. You can directly give them to us or get the web designer company to hand them to us.

Text content:
Unless agreed separately, we're not responsible for inputting text or images into your content management system or creating every page on your website. We provide the professional copywriting and editing services, so if you'd like us to create new content or input for you, we can provide seperate estimate for that.

Graphics and photographs:
You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you'd like us to search or photographs for you, we can provide a seperate estimate for that.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript:
We deliver web pages types developed from HTML, CSS for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

Browser testing:
Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different screen sizes. If does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We'll also test to ensure that people who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for Windows get an appropriate experience. We won't test in other older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

Mobile browser testing:
Mobile browser testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person's experience of a website is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they're using. We test our websites in:
iOS: Safari, Google Chrome
Android: Google Chrome

We won't test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, Windows or other mobile browsers unless we agreed separatley. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

Technical support:
We're not a website hosting company so we don't offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great! If you don't, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus ant statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a seperate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

Search engine optimisation (SEO):
We don't guarantee improvements to your website's search engine ranking, but the web pages that we develop are accessible to search engines.

Changes and revisions:
We don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the number of weeks that we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything you've told us you want to achieve, but we're happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be be a problem as we'll provide a separate estimate for those additional weeks.

Legal:
We'll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, we can't guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of them.
